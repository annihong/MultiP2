The goal of multiplexP2 is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of multiplexP2 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("annihong/multiplexP2")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(multiplexP2)
#networks = replicate(4, matrix(data=sample(c(0,1), 9, replace=TRUE), nrow=3), simplify = FALSE)
n = 5
networks = replicate(4, matrix(data=sample(c(0,1), n^2, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.7,0.3)), nrow=n), simplify = FALSE) #self loops are ignored
names(networks) <-  c("network1", "network2", "network_covariate1",      "network_covariate2")
actor_data = data.frame(actor_attr1=1:n, actor_attr2=1:n)


m <- MultiP2Fit(outcome = c("network1", "network2"), 
network_data = networks, 
actor_data = actor_data, 
senders_covar=c("actor_attr1", "actor_attr2"),
iter=100,chains=2,thin=10,
#stan_file = "multiplex_p2.stan",
stan_file = "multiplex_p2_low_mem.stan",
receivers_covar = c("actor_attr1", "actor_attr2"),
density_covar = c("network_covariate1","network_covariate2"),
reciprocity_covar = c("network_covariate1","network_covariate2"),
cross_density_covar = c("network_covariate1","network_covariate2"), )

#uniplex
m <- MultiP2Fit(outcome = c("network1"), 
network_data = networks, 
actor_data = actor_data, 
senders_covar=c("actor_attr1", "actor_attr2"),
iter=100,
stan_file = "multiplex_p2.stan",
receivers_covar = c("actor_attr1", "actor_attr2"),
density_covar = c("network_covariate1","network_covariate2"),
reciprocity_covar = c("network_covariate1","network_covariate2"))
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
